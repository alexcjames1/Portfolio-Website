                        tied together by using the pattern as either an accent or a background. I also used red lines throughout as
                        dividers of information because it gives a cohesive look to their print items and also gives more legibility
                        to the information on the item. On the folder, the larger, pictorial logo is meant to bleed onto the front,
                        showing half of the logo on the inside and outside. The folder is grey to provide contrast to the logo and
                        the print collateral that would be stored inside.

                        back to the shape of the logo. I made the name larger than the logo because, on the badge, the name should be more important
                        within the hierarchy of the design. Employee uniforms come in grey and white only becuase those are the two other color in the
                        primary palette and the logo is not allowed to be reversed in color.
