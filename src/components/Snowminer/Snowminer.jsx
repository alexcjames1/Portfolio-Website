                    <span className={style.bold}>Packaging:</span> To create the packaging for the Method&trade; beauty line, I chose to use abstract magma imagery as it
                        communicates the idea of a volcano in a much more interesting way than simply using a picture of a volcano. I also chose to use black as an integral part of
                        the secondary packaging design because it adds drama to the package and creates a high-end feel when compared to other health and beauty products. For the primary
                        packaging, I chose to use a bright orange color because, as the inside of the secondary packaging is black, when the user opens the box, there is a surprise with the orange
                        heavily contrasting the black.

                    <span className={style.bold}>Stationery:</span> To create the brochure, I chose to use the magma imagery on the cover because it acts as a stimulus image
                        and will easily grab the attention of the user. In the introduction, I felt it was important to keep it simple and allow the user to ease into the content,
                        which is why I chose to simply use my color palette as the background to the pages. Although the introduction is used to ease the user into the content, I am
                        using the bright orange to keep their attention and draw them into the other pages of the brochure. On the main content pages, I chose to keep as similar layout
                        and let the imagery create the variety, as changes in layout could overwhelm the user with information.
                        <br/>
                        In the Method&trade; stationery system, I chose to use the magma imagery as an accent to the content of the system. I chose to make the folder black because I associated
                        it with the emotions I wanted the user to feel when they were opening the packaging, with the secondary item being black and the internal collateral being the attention grabber.
